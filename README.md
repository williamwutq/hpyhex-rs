# hpyhex-rs
Simplified implementations of the HappyHex game components and hexagonal system in Rust.

## Overview
This repository contains a Rust implementation of the core components of the HappyHex game, including a hexagonal grid system and basic game mechanics. The project aims to provide a foundation for building more complex games based on hexagonal grids.

The original HappyHex game, in Java, can be found at [HappyHex on GitHub](https://github.com/williamwutq/game_HappyHex). An implementation in Python for machine learning purposes is available at [hpyhexml](https://github.com/williamwutq/hpyhexml/tree/main/hpyhex).

## Features
- Hexagonal grid representation
- Basic game mechanics for HappyHex
- Utility functions for hexagonal calculations
